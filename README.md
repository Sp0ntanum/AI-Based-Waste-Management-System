# Smart Waste Classifier & EXP Tracker

## ♻️ Overview
The **Smart Waste Classifier & EXP Tracker** is an AI-powered web application designed to classify waste items using image recognition and provide users with recycling guidelines. Additionally, it helps track waste footprint and rewards users with EXP points and achievements for sustainable waste disposal practices.

## 🚀 Features
- **Waste Classification**: Upload an image of waste, and the AI model predicts the type of waste with a confidence score.
- **EXP Tracking & Achievements**: Earn experience points (EXP) for correctly identifying waste and unlock achievements.
- **Waste Footprint Tracker**: Log daily waste production and visualize weekly & monthly waste statistics.
- **Recycling Center Map**: Locate nearby recycling centers on an interactive map.
- **Education Hub**: Access quizzes, videos, and articles to improve recycling knowledge.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Backend)
- **Streamlit** (Web UI)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Image Classification Model)
- **Pandas & Plotly** (Data Visualization)
- **Folium & Streamlit-Folium** (Interactive Maps)
- **PIL & NumPy** (Image Processing)
